The following ImageMagick commands were devised to convert black / #ff00ff (pink) backgrounds to transparency, and bmp to png


This command fills all black pixels connected to an edge of the image to transparency, and saves as a png with transparency layer.
mogrify -bordercolor black -border 1x1 -alpha set -channel RGBA -fill non -floodfill +0+0 black -shave 1x1 -format png *.bmp

For the pink-backgrounded buildings, I used this to remove the pink and also get clean edges using fuzz
mogrify -transparent #ff00ff -fuzz 35% -format png *.bmp

For the units, I switched to Linux and used
find -name "*.bmp" -exec mogrify -transparent \#ff00ff -format png {} +

To replace all pink backgrounded image files recursively with pngs. Originally, I added " -exec rm {} +" to the end of that to also remove the bitmaps afterwards, but something went wrong there, causing about 1 in 20 files to be deleted first, and imagemagick then complained the file was missing.
